The camera entity will be automaticaly added.
The proscenic cloud is used to generate the map.

## Available attributes

Theses attributes are available to be displayed on lovelace-ui:
- `clear_area`: number of m2 cleaned
- `clear_duration`: last clean duration in second
- `error_code`: the current error code, if vacuum is on error status
- `error_detail`: the current error message (in english), if vacuum is on error status

## Know issue

- At home assistant startup the vacuum cleaner status is not retrieved. You should perform an action on home assistant to get the vacuum cleaner status.
- If you start the proscenic application, the status of the vacuum cleaner will not be refreshed on home assistant for 60 seconds.
- If you start the proscenic application, you will be disconnected 60 seconds later. You can configure this time using `sleep_duration_on_exit` configuration.
